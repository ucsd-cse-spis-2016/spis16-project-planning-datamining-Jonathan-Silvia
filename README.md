Jonathan H. Silvia L., Data Mining, Mentor: David Shan

We plan to gather many different tweets that are about the candidates for this years upcoming presidential election.
We will identify postive and negative tweets concerning both candidates and compare them to each other to find out
which of them is the most popular.

Stage 1:
Get the data from twitter with keywords pertaining to the 2016 presidential candidates.

Stage 2:
Identify if those tweets are postive or negative. As we identify positive and negative tweets, we can create list 
of postive and negative keywords.

Stage 3:
Compare the candidates data and find out which one is the most popular.
