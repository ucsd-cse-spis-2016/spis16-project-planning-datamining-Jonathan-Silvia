Jonathan H. Silvia L., Data Mining, Mentor: David Shan

We plan to analyze the type of food people want to eat and at what time they want to eat
this food so that we can create a personalized menu that fits some person's taste. We
would also create a database on a person's calorie intake.

Stage 1: 
Gather data on time, taste, calories, and type of food. 

Stage 2:
Start with recommendations of a single type of food, depending on the user's input. 

Stage 3:
Recommends an entire meal.

Stage 4: 
Find an affordable price range.
